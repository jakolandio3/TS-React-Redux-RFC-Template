# React-Redux template Functional Component version (with TS + TailwindCss)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This Project has also been integrated with TailwindCss, Redux and Typescript

## Purpose

1. Create a template for using React and Redux with Typescript
2. Create re-usable components (Classes or functional Components) for ease of development
3. Provide a reference to structure of Redux and React Apps
4. Provide a Learning tool to build upon
5. Be able to render components on the client side with no Errors or type warnings consistently
6. Fetch data with strict type references and update/delete items on the client side
7. API driven fetching handled by Reducer functions and middleware (thunk)
8. Filter based API fetching and Data handling with Strict TypeChecking

### Available Scripts

1.`npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode.(default on Localhost:3000)

2.`npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Notes

1. Additional Packages used: `react-redux`,`redux`,`redux-thunk`,`axios`,`daisyui`,`tailwindcss`

2. API client for test project: `registry.npmjs.org/-/v1/search?text=`

3. Export Modules: All modules in ./src with ext of html,js,ts,jsx,tsx

4. All packages are at latest as of late-Jan 2024.

5. Naming conventions for 'Packages' from fetch data will be named 'Repositories' in the test project due to reserved keyword of package in TS
